# Eye Movement project
## Created with starter code from MIT xPro program
### Description
  This project tracks the user's cursor and two eyes follow their movement around the page. The challenge was to create a second eye, with the first eye having been provided.
  
### How to Run
  Move your mouse near the eyes and they will follow your cursor.
  
### Roadmap
 I'd love to expand this to include an action on click. For example, maybe I could make the eyes blink.
